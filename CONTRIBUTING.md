## Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

Example:

```js
const { MessageEmbed } = require('discord.js');

module.exports.config = {
    name: 'mycommand',
    aliases: ['mc', 'myc']
};

module.exports.hmd = async (client, message, args, config) => {
    // Your command logic here
};
```
